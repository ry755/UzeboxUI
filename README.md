# UzeboxUI

A simple GUI for Uzebox inspired by the original Macintosh System Software

### Note: this software is buggy/unfinished/unreleased and is not currently being worked on, the code is a mess and should probably be mostly rewritten (if you look at the code, you'll see what I mean. I'm sorry)

## Features
- External application support with [EmbedVM by Clifford Wolf](http://www.clifford.at/embedvm/), a very unfinished (and very poorly designed) API is provided for creating small UzeboxUI applications
- Dynamic "Apps" submenu loaded and parsed from a text file on the SD card
- Dynamic splash screen loaded on startup from a raw image file on the SD card
- Customizable wallpaper tile (theoretically it should be possible to use a ramtile for this to have a user-designed tile, but this is not currently implemented)
